Here's a sonnet inspired by Batman:\n\nIn shadows deep, a hero takes his flight,\nA symbol of justice, a beacon of might.\nWith cape and cowl, he prowls the dark night,\nProtecting the innocent, fighting for what's right.\n\nGotham's protector, with a heart of steel,\nHe battles the villains, their evil he'll repeal.\nWith gadgets and skills, he'll never yield,\nA symbol of hope, a city's shield.\n\nBut beneath the mask, a man does reside,\nHaunted by darkness, his demons he hides.\nA tragic past, a vow to abide,\nTo bring justice to those who've died.\n\nOh Batman, a hero both feared and revered,\nYour legacy will forever be revered.\n\nI hope you enjoy this Batman-inspired sonnet! Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with."
