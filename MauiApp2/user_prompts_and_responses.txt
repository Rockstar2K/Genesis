  In the town of Mystic Falls,                                                 
  Where the night forever calls,                                               
  Lives a tale of love and fright,                                             
  Underneath the moon's soft light.                                            
                                                                               
  Vampires, witches, werewolves roam,                                          
  In this place they call their home.                                          
  Secrets hidden, truths untold,                                               
  A story of love, centuries old.                                              
                                                                               
  Elena, Stefan, Damon's plight,                                               
  Their love story, a constant fight.                                          
  A triangle of love and hate,                                                 
  A destiny they cannot escape.                                                
                                                                               
  In the shadows, danger lurks,                                                
  As the power of darkness works.                                              
  Yet in their hearts, love prevails,                                          
  In the tale of Vampire Diaries' tales.
