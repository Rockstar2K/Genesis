   1 Use Python's requests library to send a request to a service that         
     provides the public IP address.                                           
   2 Extract the IP address from the response and return it to the user.       
                                                                               
  Let's start by executing the Python code to get your public IP address.      
                                                                               
                                                                               
  import requests                                                              
                                                                               
  response = requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')                             
  response.text                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                               
  '45.232.94.146'                                                              
                                                                                                                                                              
  Your public IP address is 45.232.94.146.
